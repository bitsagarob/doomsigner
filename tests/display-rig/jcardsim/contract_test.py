"""Does the Python fake still answer like the real applet?

There are two cards in this project. `FakeCardWithSecrets` in the app's own test
suite is a few hundred lines of Python that imitates the nonce vault, and it is
what 1800 unit tests run against, because they cannot each start a JVM. The
SeedKeeper applet is the Java that gets flashed. Nothing checked that the two
agree, so the applet could change and every test would keep passing against an
imitation that had quietly become wrong.

This runs the same sequence against both and compares what comes back. It does
not compare byte for byte: a nonce is random, so two cards asked for one will
answer differently and should. What must match is the shape and the rules --
the sizes, and above all the refusals, since the refusals are the security
property.

What it binds, exactly, so the name does not promise more than it checks:

    both rounds reach the same stage, and produce the same signature count
    a replayed sealed nonce is refused, with the same error
    a sealed nonce whose bytes were edited is refused
    the pool is refilled to the same depth, with the same sized entries
    the sealed nonce is the same size

What it does not bind: behaviour under an unverified PIN, the status word of
every error path, the internal format of a seal, and anything about eviction
once more nonces are outstanding than the card tracks. Those are worth adding;
they are not covered today.
