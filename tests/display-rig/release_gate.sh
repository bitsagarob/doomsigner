# this good enough to ship", and it cannot be: it prints "display layer: ran"
# whether the probes proved anything or timed out, and it exits 0 either way.
# This reads the pass it produced and requires each probe to have said the thing
# it exists to say.
#
# What it will not let past:
#
#   an app tree with uncommitted changes, because the release would not be
#     reproducible from the commit it claims to be
#   a partial pass, where the applet layer was skipped for want of a JVM
#   a probe that produced no verdict, crashed, or left a Traceback
#   a capture that decoded to no screens
#
# What it cannot do is look at the screens. A screen can render perfectly and
# still say the wrong thing, which has happened here, and no assertion catches
# that. So the gate ends by naming the screens a human still has to open.

GATE: the automated half passed. $SCREENS screen(s) captured.

Not done yet. A screen can render perfectly and still say the wrong thing, and
no check here can tell. Open these before tagging:

  $OUT/flow-musig2/     the whole musig2 round, in order
  $OUT/offer/           the card offer screen and its wording
  $OUT/refusal/         what a refused card looks like

Then tag. This script does not tag, publish or upload anything.
