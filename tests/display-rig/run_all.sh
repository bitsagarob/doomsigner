# Two layers, and a pass says which of them it ran:
#
#   display   the app's real driver on a real kernel SPI bus, inside UML
#   applet    the real SeedKeeper applet in jCardSim behind real pysatochip
#
# The applet layer needs JAVA_HOME, JCARDSIM_JAR and APPLET_SRC. Without them it
# is skipped loudly and the summary says the pass was partial, because a run that
# quietly covers less than it claims is worse than one that fails.
#
# Existed because a "full test" was several hand-run scripts, which meant it was
# run less often than it should have been and slightly differently each time.
#
# Results land in a dated directory: the probes' output as text, and every
# screen as a numbered PNG. Picking which frames are worth publishing is still a
# human step; this gets you to the point of choosing.
#
# Everything under the sandbox is build output. It is deleted and regenerated
# from this directory on every run, so nothing there is worth editing and a
# stale copy cannot survive to be tested by mistake. Change a probe here.
