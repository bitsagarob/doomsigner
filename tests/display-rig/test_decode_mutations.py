"""Break the decoder on purpose, and check test_decode_st7789.py notices.

A test suite that has never been seen to fail proves nothing. Every check in
test_decode_st7789.py passed the first time it was run, which is exactly the
state a vacuous test is in, so each one is answered here by a change that should
break it.

It found two real gaps on its first run. A gpio event was only ever tested with
the data/command line low, so a decoder that ignored the gpio flag read those
two bytes as harmless commands and no check moved; on the device that line is
usually high and they would have been read as pixels. And inversion was only
checked before any pixel existed, so negating an all-black frame changed nothing
the check looked at.

Each mutation is applied to a throwaway copy. Nothing here edits the rig.
