# SeedSigner OS — Agent Guidelines

## Deterministic & Reproducible Builds (Non-Dev Configs)

Non-dev builds (`pi0-smartcard`, `pi2-smartcard`, `pi4-smartcard`, etc.) are designed to be **deterministic and reproducible**. This means:

* Every build from the same commit must produce byte-identical output images.
* All external assets (firmware, pre-built OS images, tool archives) are downloaded by URL and verified against a hardcoded SHA-256 checksum.
* Never introduce non-deterministic behaviour into post-image or post-build scripts: no timestamps embedded in files, no random data, no host-dependent paths leaking into the image.
* When adding new downloads to a script, always include both the download step **and** a `sha256sum` verification (use the existing `download_and_verify()` helper where available).
* If a change affects only `-dev` configs, keep it out of non-dev scripts entirely.

## Local Testing of Scripts

Wherever possible, validate script changes locally before pushing to CI. The full buildroot build takes 1–2 hours per board; many failures can be caught in seconds with synthetic test data.

### Post-Image / Post-Build Scripts

These scripts operate on disk images produced by `genimage`. You can reproduce their environment without a full build:

1. **Create a synthetic disk image** matching the genimage layout (MBR + FAT32 partition):
   ```bash
   dd if=/dev/zero of=test.img bs=1M count=256 status=none
   sfdisk test.img <<EOF
   label: dos
   unit: sectors
   test.img1 : start=2048, size=204800, type=c
   EOF
   # Format the partition in-place at the correct offset
   dd if=/dev/zero of=boot.vfat bs=512 count=204800 status=none
   mkfs.vfat -n "SEEDSIGNDEV" boot.vfat >/dev/null 2>&1
   dd if=boot.vfat of=test.img bs=512 seek=2048 conv=notrunc status=none
   ```

2. **Extract the partition offset** from the MBR (byte 454, little-endian uint32):
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import struct; print(struct.unpack('<I', open('test.img','rb').read()[454:458])[0] * 512)"
   # → 1048576 (sector 2048 × 512)
   ```

3. **Run the mtools commands** from the script against the synthetic image and verify they succeed or fail as expected:
   ```bash
   MTOOLS_SKIP_CHECK=1 mmd -i "test.img@@1048576" ::javacard-cap
   MTOOLS_SKIP_CHECK=1 mdir -i "test.img@@1048576" ::/
   ```

4. **Negative tests** are equally important — verify that known-bad syntaxes (`::1`, `:p1`, bare image) fail as expected, so regressions are caught early.

See `tests/test_post_image_mtools.sh` for a working example that exercises all five post-image scripts against a synthetic image in under a second.

### Boot-Import Check on a Finished Image

A build goes green whenever buildroot finishes, including when the resulting image
contains an app that cannot start. The app is cloned from its own repo while the Python
libraries come from buildroot packages, so a module the app imports at the top of a file
can simply be absent from the image. Nothing in the build notices, `requirements.txt` is
stripped out of the rootfs, and the only symptom is a device that boots to a black screen.

`tests/test_image_userland.py` closes that gap without a Raspberry Pi and without root:

```bash
python3 tests/test_image_userland.py images/seedsigner_os.dev_.pi0-smartcard.img
```

It reads `zImage` out of the image's FAT32 partition with mtools, unpacks the initramfs
the kernel carries (gzip, lz4 or xz), and then imports every `seedsigner.*` module the
image ships using **the image's own ARM python3** under `qemu-arm-static`. About 13
seconds per image. Requires `mtools`, `cpio`, `lz4` and `qemu-user-static`; it exits 0
with a `SKIP:` line if any of those is missing.

Two behaviours worth knowing before trusting a red run:

* `seedsigner.controller` is imported first, because `main.py` does. Anything that still
  fails is retried once at the end. Several view modules break an import cycle by
  importing each other at the bottom of the file (`tools_views.py` ends with
  `from .gpg_views import *`), so importing one of those first fails where the device,
  which always arrives from the other side, succeeds. A library genuinely missing from
  the image fails both passes.
* It proves the image is self-consistent, not that it is correct. It does not run the
  wallet, drive the screen, or reproduce the Pi Zero's ARMv6 CPU or 512 MB of RAM.

This check found `pi0`, `pi0-dev`, `pi02w`, `pi02w-dev`, `pi2`, `pi2-dev`, `pi4` and
`pi4-dev` shipping without `python-shamir-mnemonic` while `seed_views.py` imports it at
module scope, which takes `seedsigner.controller` down with it. Only the `-smartcard`
profiles had the package, and only those are built in CI, so nothing had noticed.

### Custom Module Downloads & Hash Checks

When a script downloads external assets:
* Verify the SHA-256 checksum matches what you expect by downloading the file locally first and running `sha256sum`.
* If the upstream changes the hash (e.g., a new release), update the constant in the script — never skip verification.

### Buildroot Post-Build / Post-Install Scripts

These run inside the buildroot container with `$TARGET_DIR`, `$STAGING_DIR`, etc. set. To test locally:
* Set the variables to local paths pointing at a minimal rootfs or empty directory.
* Source the script and step through it, checking that file operations target the right locations.

> **Commit scripts as executable (mode `100755`).** Buildroot invokes `BR2_ROOTFS_POST_BUILD_SCRIPT` and `BR2_ROOTFS_POST_IMAGE_SCRIPT` directly (not via `sh <script>`), so a script committed non-executable (`100644`) fails `target-finalize` with exit code **126**. This is easy to miss when authoring on Windows, where the working tree doesn't carry a Unix exec bit. Set it explicitly and verify what git recorded:
> ```sh
> git update-index --chmod=+x opt/<profile>/board/post-build.sh opt/<profile>/board/post-image-seedsigner.sh
> git ls-files -s opt/<profile>/board/*.sh   # each must show mode 100755
> ```

### General Principles

* **Fail fast**: if a tool is missing (e.g., `mtools`, `sfdisk`), skip with a clear message rather than silently passing.
* **Clean up**: use `trap cleanup EXIT` to remove temp directories on failure.
* **Pin versions**: when tests depend on external tools, note the expected version or behaviour so changes in tooling don't silently break things.

## Build Profile Conventions

Profiles are located under `opt/{profile-name}/`. Full documentation is in [docs/build_profiles.md](docs/build_profiles.md).

### Naming Pattern

`{board}[-smartcard][-dev]` — e.g. `pi0-smartcard`, `lafrite-smartcard-dev`.

- **`-smartcard`**: Adds NFC reader stack (`libnfc-pn532-i2c`, `ccid`, `ifdnfc`, `openct`), JavaCard crypto tools (`gnupg2`, `pycryptodome-x`, `pysatochip`), and DIY tools squashfs (Java JDK + Ant + Satochip source) on the boot partition.
- **`-dev`**: Adds networking (SSH via dropbear, git, curl, wget, pip, WiFi tools, DHCP). Uses `genimage` for image creation (non-reproducible). Includes `rootfs-overlay-dev/` for MicroSD source override.

### What Changes Between Dev and Non-Dev

| Level | Dev | Non-Dev |
|-------|-----|---------|
| **defconfig** | +dropbear, git, curl, wget, pip, wifi tools, DHCP, nano, mc | Minimal packages only |
| **busybox.config** | Networking applets enabled (ifconfig, ip, ping, udhcpc, wget) | All networking applets disabled |
| **kernel config** | INET, IPV6, NETDEVICES, DRM, FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE enabled | All disabled (air-gapped, no display output) |
| **post-build.sh** | Copies `rootfs-overlay-dev/` into target | No dev overlay copy |
| **post-image script** | Uses `genimage` (non-reproducible) | Manual deterministic: dd + sfdisk + mkfs.vfat --invariant + mcopy, fixed timestamps (`2023/01/01T12:15:05`), pinned bootloader SHA-256 |

### Non-Dev Hardening (no information leakage)

Non-dev (production) images are **air-gapped and headless by design** — they must not emit or accept anything over networking, HDMI, or serial. Every vector below must be closed; a profile can build green with any of them left open, and several only surface on real hardware (or a serial capture), so verify there — not just from a green CI run.

| Leak vector | How it's closed (non-dev) | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **Networking** | `CONFIG_INET`/`IPV6`/`NETDEVICES`/`PACKET` off; no dropbear / wifi / dhcp / curl packages | kernel config + defconfig |
| **HDMI / video console** | `CONFIG_DRM`/`FB`/`FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE` off (the UI LCD is SPI/userspace, unaffected) | kernel config |
| **Kernel serial console** | no `console=<serial>`, no `earlyprintk`; route the console to a null sink via `console=ttynull` + `CONFIG_NULL_TTY=y` | cmdline (`boot_cmdline.txt` / `extlinux.conf`) + kernel config |
| **Serial login prompt** | `# BR2_TARGET_GENERIC_GETTY is not set` (no getty on any tty) | defconfig |
| **System logging daemons** | `post-build.sh` removes `S01syslogd` / `S02klogd` | post-build.sh |

**Silencing the serial console differs by platform** — get this right per-board:
- **Pi**: the firmware (`boot_config.txt`) doesn't route the console to the UART, so the cmdline simply omits `console=`. That also frees `/dev/ttyAMA0` (via `dtoverlay=disable-bt`) for the SEC1210 reader, which shares that UART — here serial output would actively break the reader.
- **Lafrite**: the DTS sets `chosen/stdout-path = "serial0"` (`ttyAML0`), so **omitting `console=` is not enough** — the DT still routes the console to serial. Pass `console=ttynull` explicitly (a cmdline `console=` sets `console_set_on_cmdline`, which makes the kernel ignore the DT stdout-path), and provide `ttynull` via `CONFIG_NULL_TTY=y`. The SEC1210 reader is on a *separate* UART (`/dev/ttyAML6`), so console and reader don't collide as on the Pi — but the console is still silenced to meet the no-leak requirement.

### Kernel Config Approaches by Platform

- **Pi profiles**: Full `kernel.config` files. Dev configs add networking/display options at the bottom of an otherwise identical base config. Non-dev configs strip them out.
- **Lafrite profile**: Uses `BR2_LINUX_KERNEL_USE_ARCH_DEFAULT_CONFIG=y` with a kernel fragment (`kernel-fragment.config`). The arm64 arch default builds many drivers as **modules**, and the initramfs has **no on-disk module tree**, so every driver the device needs must be forced `=y` in the fragment: serial, MMC, SPI (the LCD), HW RNG, **and USB host + UVC (`USB_XHCI_HCD`, `USB_DWC3`, `USB_VIDEO_CLASS`, `MEDIA_*`, `VIDEOBUF2_*`) — the La Frite camera is USB (`/dev/video1`)**. Build the non-dev fragment as *dev fragment minus networking*: keep all the hardware `=y` forcing, and only add the non-dev disables (INET, IPV6, NETDEVICES, PACKET, and optionally DRM/FB/FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE — the LCD is SPI/userspace and needs none of them). Dropping a required `=y` driver builds fine but leaves that hardware dead at runtime (e.g. no camera).

### Rootfs Overlay Structure

Three distinct overlays — do not confuse them:

- **`opt/rootfs-overlay/`** (top-level, shared by ALL profiles) — the SeedSigner userspace: the app at `/opt/src`, `/etc/init.d/S02seedsigner`, `/etc/fstab`, and **`/start.sh`** (the launcher that `S02seedsigner` runs). **Every profile's `BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY` must list this overlay.**
- **`<profile>/board/rootfs-overlay/`** (per-profile) — hardware config only (mdev.conf, reader.conf.d).
- **`opt/rootfs-overlay-dev/`** (dev-only) — networking + a MicroSD-source-override `start.sh` that *overrides* the shared `/start.sh`. Copied by dev profiles' `post-build.sh`; absent in non-dev, so non-dev uses the shared headless `/start.sh`.

> **`BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY` must include the shared overlay.** Set it to `"../rootfs-overlay/ ../<profile>/board/rootfs-overlay/"` (shared first, board second), matching `lafrite-smartcard-dev`. If you list only the board overlay, the app, init scripts, and `/start.sh` are all missing — **the build still succeeds, but the booted image never launches SeedSigner (blank screen).** This is only detectable by actually booting the image, so verify it on hardware (or via the serial console) before assuming a green build works.

### Image Creation Methods

- **Dev**: `genimage` with `genimage-seedsigner.cfg`. Fast, but embeds build-time metadata (non-reproducible).
- **Non-dev**: Manual script that creates disk image via dd, partitions with sfdisk (fixed label-id `ba5eba11`), formats FAT32 with `mkfs.vfat --invariant`, copies files via mcopy with normalized timestamps. Produces byte-identical output across builds.

### Adding a New Profile

When creating a new profile (e.g. `lafrite-smartcard` from `lafrite-smartcard-dev`):
1. Copy hardware files unchanged: extlinux.conf, boot.cmd, DTS, genimage-diy-tools.cfg, rootfs-overlay, Config.in, external.mk
2. Create defconfig: remove dev packages, update paths to the new profile name. **`BR2_ROOTFS_OVERLAY` must list the shared overlay AND the board overlay** — `"../rootfs-overlay/ ../<profile>/board/rootfs-overlay/"` (see [Rootfs Overlay Structure](#rootfs-overlay-structure)); omitting `../rootfs-overlay/` produces a blank-screen image that still builds green.
3. Create post-build.sh: adapt from existing non-dev profile for the target architecture (armhf vs aarch64)
4. Create busybox.config: copy from equivalent non-dev profile (minimal networking)
5. Create kernel config or fragment: force `=y` every hardware driver the device needs (serial, MMC, SPI, HW RNG, **and USB + UVC for USB-camera boards** — modules in the arch default won't load with no initramfs module tree), keeping parity with the dev fragment; then add only the non-dev disables (INET, IPV6, NETDEVICES, PACKET, optionally DRM/FB/FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE). See [Kernel Config Approaches by Platform](#kernel-config-approaches-by-platform).
6. Create post-image script: deterministic manual approach with pinned bootloader SHA-256
7. Update external.desc: keep buildroot's `key: value` format with a `name:` line (all profiles use `name: RPI_SEEDSIGNER`, referenced by `external.mk` as `BR2_EXTERNAL_RPI_SEEDSIGNER_PATH`); remove "Dev" from the `desc:`. A missing `name:` aborts the build with "external.desc does not define the name".
8. Set the executable bit on `post-build.sh` and the post-image script and confirm it before committing (see the note under [Buildroot Post-Build / Post-Install Scripts](#buildroot-post-build--post-install-scripts)). Non-executable scripts fail at `target-finalize` with exit code 126.
9. Confirm every leak vector is closed for non-dev — networking, HDMI, kernel serial console (`console=ttynull`), serial login getty, logging daemons (see [Non-Dev Hardening](#non-dev-hardening-no-information-leakage)). These build green when left open, so verify on hardware or a serial capture.
